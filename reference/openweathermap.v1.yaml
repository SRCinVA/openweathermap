  description: "Get the current weather, daily forecasts for 16 days, and a three-hour-interval forecast for 5 days for your city. Helpful stats, graphics, and \"this day in history\" charts are available for your reference. Interactive maps show precipitation, clouds, pressure, and wind around your location's stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format. **Note**: This sample Swagger file covers the 'current' endpoint only from the OpenWatherMap API. <br/><br/> **Note**: all parameters are optional, but you must select at least one parameter. Calling the API by city ID (using the 'id' parameter) will provide the most precise location results."
